This is to announce libntlm-1.7, a stable release.

Libntlm provides routines to manipulate the structures used for the
client end of Microsoft NTLM authentication.  This code was initially
taken (mostly) from the Samba project and was initially intended for use
with Microsoft Exchange Server when it is configured to require NTLM
authentication for clients of it's IMAP server.  Today, Libntlm contains
re-written code, so that the license is now LGPLv2+.

See the NEWS below for a brief summary.

The project page of the library is available at:
  https://gitlab.com/gsasl/libntlm/
