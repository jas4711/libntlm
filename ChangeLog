	We no longer manually curate a ChangeLog file.
	You may use `git log` to show git commit log messages.

	If you downloaded this file through a tarball, you will have to
	retrieve the git repository to read commit history, see README for
	links to the repository.

	This file used to be automatically generated from git history, but
	that made it impossible to re-create the tarball from a "git
	archive"-style copy of the project.

	* ChangeLog: Rewrite.
